**AutomationExercise – Web/UI Automation Project**

**Project Overview:-**
AutomationExercise.com is a publicly available web application designed to support QA engineers, developers, and automation enthusiasts to practice real-world automation scenarios. 
The site offers a wide range of web elements and workflows commonly found in e-commerce applications, such as:
* User authentication (login / signup)
* Product browsing and catalog navigation
* Shopping cart operations
* Checkout and order placement
* User accounts
This project is built to automate end-to-end test scenarios of AutomationExercise.com using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. It showcases a scalable and maintainable automation framework that follows industry standards and best practices. By automating real user flows, this framework enables faster regression testing, repeatable validation, and robust test reporting.
The framework structure follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure separation of test logic, better readability, and maintainability.

**Project Objectives:-**
The primary goals of this automation project are:
* Convert Manual Test Cases into Automated Scripts Transform manual QA flows validated on AutomationExercise.com into stable and reusable automated test cases.
* Build a Scalable Automation Framework Design a framework that is maintainable, modular, and extensible to support future test additions and enhancements.
* Leverage Industry-Standard Tools and Practices Utilize Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven, adhering to automation and coding best practices.
* Follow Page Object Model (POM) Design Separate page element locators and actions from test logic, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
* Enable Clear Test Reporting and Debugging Integrate Extent Reports to generate detailed execution reports containing step logs and screenshots for failure analysis.
* Implement TestNG Test Suites for Organized Execution Group tests logically for regression, sanity, and other execution needs with suite XML configurations.
* Support Cross-Environment Execution Facilitate execution against different environments and configurations without modifying core logic.
* Lay Foundation for CI/CD Integration Structure the project to be easily integrated with pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for automated execution.

**End-to-End Web Automation Flow:-**

As part of this automation framework, the following complete end-to-end user journey has been automated and validated:
* Navigate to the AutomationExercise website
* User Login with valid credentials
* Home Page verification and product selection
* Add selected product to cart
* Open and validate cart page
* Proceed to checkout
* Enter payment and billing details
* Place the order successfully
* Verify order confirmation message
This flow simulates a real customer purchase journey and ensures that all major functional components of the application work seamlessly together.

**Framework Components:-**
**Core Layer (core/)**
Contains base framework components:
* BaseTestCase.java → Test setup & teardown
* DriverManager.java → WebDriver initialization
Handles browser lifecycle and common configurations.

**Page Layer (pages/)**
Implements Page Object Model:
* Each web page has a dedicated class
* Contains locators and actions
* Separates UI logic from test logic
Improves maintainability and reusability.
